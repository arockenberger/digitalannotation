# How to contribute

Do you want to contribute to this translation? Awesome! 

## Rules of the game

Be kind, all else is details.

I do not have a specific Code of Conduct but please keep in mind that I am a human being, too, when you create or comment on Issues, Pull-Requests or take contact.

Here is how you can do that practically:

## You want to translate something into Norwegian - or into English

For practical reasons, I will start with a translation into **English**.
If you want to contribute to the **Norwegian** translation instead, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/arockenberger/digitalannotation/issues) on which part you want to translate and I will get back to you with a more concrete 'How To'.

## You want to translate a (larger) part of the original material

If you want to contribute a larger part of the translation, please create an [Issue](https://github.com/arockenberger/digitalannotation/issues) and tell me which part you would like to translate. I will create a markdown file for you in this repository which you can then fork.

## You have a suggestion for a better, more fitting translation

If you think a sentence, a phrase, or terminology could be improved, please fork this repository and create a pull-request with a short comment.

## You spotted a typo, a spelling mistake or something else small but annoying

If you see smaller errors or typographical annoyances, please fork this repository and create a pull-request with a short comment.

## You want to become a co-translator

Yes, this is possible! If you are interested in co-authorship for the English or the Norwegian translation, please contact me via email!
